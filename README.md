# International-Brewery-Analysis-SQL-Capstone-Project-
This project is a case study of an International Brewery that needs some insights on the general performance of their products. This is my Capstone Project on SQL and i decided to put it out on a dashboard as well for futher insightful analysis. 

Tools used to carry out this project include:

Postgresql: I used this tool write SQL codes to provide answers and generate insights from the datasets given.
Microsoft Power BI: This was used to carry out visualization of my analysis.
